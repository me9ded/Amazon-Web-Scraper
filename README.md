# Amazon-Web-Scraper
This is a basic project that I did while learning the basics of web scraping using python.

the image above  shows the result after executing the code as it resulted in an excel file that showcases the scraped data.

I've used notebook and anaconda so that i get used to them as this is my first time implmenting them in one of my projects.
